                <br>Adobe's website seems to do a good job following the "rule of thirds" guidline.
                The most important message begins in the northwest quadrant of the page, which
                gets roughly 41 percent of all website visitor's eyes. Also, in non desktop view, 
                the cards are divided into the page quadrants, which helps the visitor quickly scan
                the pertinent content.<br>

                <br>Samsung's web designer(s) have done an excellent job of providing plenty of whitespace on the page.
                Nothing drives me more crazy when there is so much content packed into the inital viewpor
                of a website, one cannot even determine what the website is all about. It would be interesting
                to see the average duration of each visitor to a jam packed website versus one like Samsung who
                gives you a chance to focus and learn what the site is all about by spending more time there.<br>

                <br>Clean Simple Eat's website does a great job showing the design guidline of using contrast.
                Some might say "you should bring color to a black and white world" but sometimes the simplicity 
                of black and white works well - like it does for the Clean Simple Eats page. For example, the white background
                with black text versus the black background with white text. It makes it so easy to read this site.<br>
